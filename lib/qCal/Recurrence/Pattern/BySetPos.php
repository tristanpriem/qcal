/**
 * BySetPos Recurrence Rule
 * After defining a recurrence pattern, this particular rule can be used to
 * select certain instances from within the recurrence pattern. So, if your
 * recurrence pattern selects every other day in January, and then you specify
 * this rule as "1" and "5", it will select the 1st and 5th instances in that
 * recurrence set.
