# Update #

The very first version of this library has finally been released. It is a pre-alpha release, so don't expect much, but please check it out if you're interested. You can [read more](http://lukevisinoni.com/2009/12/31/qcal-v001-released/) on my website.

## Documentation is under way! ##

## What is qCal? ##

qCal is an extensible, object-oriented iCalendar reader/generator for PHP5. It is based on the iCalendar v2.0 specification ([RFC 2445](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt)) and it uses common design patterns and best practices. I have been working on it off and on for several years, but it is finally seeing its first real release cycle because it has recently received some funding.

The next version of the library will contain documentation for every feature. Expect that release on January 14th and each subsequent release on every other Thursday following that date.

More coming soon!
