Features we'd like for the first release (v0.10)

 * Import an icalendar file, add events to it, output it again.

Unit tests we need

 * We need to test all property classes to see that they comply with the rfc (parameter names, values)
 * We need to test that qCal only accepts the values permitted in the rfc

Miscillaneous Notes:

 * I'm wondering if we should include some type of log inside the core qCal class so that when errors happen they are logged rather than shoved in the user's face
