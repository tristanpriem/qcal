Features we'd like for the first release (v0.10)

 * Import an icalendar file, add events to it, output it again. 
 *  

Unit tests we need

 * We need to test all property classes to see that they comply with the rfc (parameter names, values)
 * We need to test that qCal only accepts the values permitted in the rfc

Miscillaneous Notes:

 * I'm wondering if we should include some type of log inside the core qCal class so that when errors
   happen they are logged rather than shoved in the user's face
   
 * Josh, I'd like to talk to you about how to handle the setProperty / addProperty issue. I haven't
   yet provided a setProperty method, because some properties can be set multiple times, which would
   make that command ambiguous or at least confusing. I don't yet know what the solution to this 
   problem is. Maybe some type of $cal->setPropertyMultiple situation or something. We'll talk.
   
 * I am considering changing the way that abstract classes are handled. I normally name an abstract 
   class or a base class in the following format: qCal_Property_Abstract or qCal_Property_Base, but I
   think that I would rather just shorten it to qCal_Property in either case - the _Abstract isnt needed
